I began the project by selecting a theme that would allow flexibility in layout and styling. I chose vs code to design my website with my knowledge of html,css and javascript  to create a visually appealing layout . The design centers around a playful and professional aesthetic, which is key to attracting parents. I chose the violet and vibrant pink color scheme to evoke energy and creativity while ensuring that the page remains professional and welcoming.
I utilized responsive design techniques to ensure the landing page works seamlessly on mobile and desktop. The use of vibrant colors pink and green helps create a sense of energy, while maintaining readability through simple font.
For the hero section, I used a background image related to children's learning to capture the target audience's attention immediately. I ensured the headline was large and eye-catching, while the CTA button was strategically placed to guide users toward making a purchase. Each section (Worksheet Bundles, eBooks, Testimonials) was designed to be clear and easy to navigate. I used CSS Flexbox to arrange the content in a responsive layout, ensuring the design would adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
The testimonial section uses a JavaScript-powered slider to display parent feedback dynamically. This interactive feature enhances user engagement by making the page more dynamic. Lastly, I added contact forms and social media links in the footer, making it easy for users to get in touch.
Overall, my approach focused on creating a modern, functional landing page that would be easy to navigate, visually engaging, and lead users toward purchasing the product.
